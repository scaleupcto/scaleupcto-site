    <p class="lead mt-5">Hi, I'm Chris the Scale Up CTO.</p>

</div>


<p class="lead mt-5 mb-5">I've worked in technology for over 20 years, many of those as one of the founders and CTO of <a href="https://www.talis.com">Talis</a>, which grew from 4 people to a successful exit in 2018. I've grown and sold companies, hired workforces, built platforms, angel invested and mentored leaders. You can find out more about my experience and the people I've worked with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scaleupcto/">on my LinkedIn page</a>.</p>
